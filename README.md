# engine_3d

Example application drawing any 3d Obj-format model on the canvas 
using simple 3D engine written in Dart.

## Futures

The 3d engine completely released on basic mathematics, it is doesn't use any lib.

Engine was written basically for my personal interest, it is not powerful or super fast
but it is work correctly.
